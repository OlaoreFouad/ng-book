## ng-book

This book contains a series of chapters that carefully discuss the concepts of the Angular Frontend Framework. Being an intermediate angular developer, this book serves as a medium to re-iterate and cement the concepts I have learnt before. It also breathes meaning into some of the scary fundamentals I had issues with.

# A Breakdown Of The Chapters.

1. **Writing Your First Angular App.** <br>
    In this chapter, I built my first angular app in the book. An app that was perceived to be a reddit clone. Using basic components, models, binding and some very basic concepts were explained. The source code for this repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/OlaoreFouad/ng-book/tree/master/ng-reddit">here</a>. At the end of the chapter, I deployed the website to ZEIT now - on this <a href="https://ng-reddit.now.sh">url</a>.
